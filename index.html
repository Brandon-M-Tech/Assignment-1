  <p style="color:darkcyan;">About me:</p>
  <p style="font-size:60%;">I'm a Mechanical Fitter by trade. Born in Australia.<br>
  Looking at changing careers to become a software developer/engineer.<br>
  Me and my partner currently have 3 Dachshunds (Sausage dogs)<br>
  and one day we will most likely have a lot more.</p>

 <div class="first">
    <h2 id="interests">My interest in IT</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT started at a younge age. I have always enjoyed gaming,<br>
    and became interested in how the games were made. My specific interest in IT is primarily<br>
    programming but not just gaming, and is the reason I have decided to undertake formal study<br>
    to learn more about the topic as a whole. My experience to date involves trouble shooting common<br>
    computer problems for my family and work colleagues.</p>
  </div>
 <div class="second">
    <h2>Why I chose RMIT</h2>
    <p>I chose RMIT because their subjects and courses aligned closely with what I'd imagine<br>
    I would need to fulfil the requirements to become a software developer. After some research<br>
    you can see that RMIT was ranked highly in regards to universitys in which to study technology.</p>
  </div>
 <div class="first">
    <h2>Learning expectations</h2>
    <p>Overall I'm hoping to learn the basics of IT, i.e, the different fields I could potentially go into.<br>
    I'm planning to carry on from this and do my full Bachelor's degree, maybe even further. We will see.<br>
    Ideally I'd like to become fluent in a variety of different programming languages so that I could<br>
    take my skills into any career paths that come my way.</p>
  </div>
 <div class="job">
    <h1 id="job">Ideal job:<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/40534439?type=standout#searchRequestToken=67c9d789-6e52-4ac0-bafc-33813c6fca52"> Technical Analyst</a></h1>

    <h2 id="profile">Personal profile</h2>
    <h3>Myers-Briggs test:</h3>
    <p>Introverted-32%<br>Intuituve-1%<br>Feeling-26%<br>Judging-37%<br>
    INFJs are the rarest personality type. Only one percent of the population are INFJs.<br>
    -Warm and caring.<br>
    -Organized, and are able to juggle many responsibilities.<br>
    -Highly intuitive.<br>
    -Creative and imaginative.<br>
    -Nurturing and patient.</p>
    <h3>Learning style:</h3>
    <p>Auditory-20%<br>Visual-55%<br>Tactile-25%<br>
    Learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
    <h3>Big 5 test:</h3>
    <p>Openness-71%<br>Conscientiousness-56%<br>Extraversion-29%<br>Agreeableness-73%<br>Neuroticism-54%</p>
  </div>
 <div class="second">
    <h2>What my profile means</h2>
    <p>To me the results say that I work best by seeing how things are done first, or trialing ideas<br>
    then seeing how they can be changed to be better.<br>
    Being high in Agreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others needs ahead of their own,<br>
    and to cooperate rather than compete with others. This will work well in a team environment as I<br>
    wont be fighting other team members ideas.<br>
    Also high Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways.<br>
    High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. They enjoy playing with ideas and<br>
    discovering novel experiences.</p>

    <h1 id="project">Project idea</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Creating an app or game that teachers could give to students that would allow them<br>
    to see what learning style best suits the students needs. Potentially storing the<br>
    results in a database that could then be used at other schools if the child was to<br>
    move. The program could also recommend certain activities to give to the child.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>A 2018 report titled Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)<br>
    details the long term decline in Australian students in Science, Reading and Mathematics subjects<br>
    in comparison to Chinese students. Specifically the report details that Australian<br>
    students are on average 3.5 years behind Chinese students in mathematics. STEM is a already<br>
    underrepresented area of education within Australia, that is a known area to provide jobs<br>
    for the workforce of the future.<br>
    The purpose of this app/game is to develop a tool that could be used in Australian class rooms to provide<br>
    insight to teachers on children's preferred learning styles, which could help close the gap.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This app will be android based and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.<br>
    Students can simply register using a student ID or similar, which will then create an account<br>
    for the student where the results of games played will be stored.</p>
    <p>Auditory learners learn best by hearing instructions.<br>
    Memory games where the student can be asked to memorise as many words or numbers as possible,<br>
    by only hearing audio ques.<br>
    Asked to recreate a picture after only receiving audio instructions of what it should look like at the end.</p>
    <p>Visual learners learn best when they can see the information being taught.<br>
    Memory games can also play a part in testing for visual learner attributes.<br>
    Having a series of pictures (flashcards) flick past the screen at a certain speed,<br>
    then have the student recall as many as they can.<br>
    Playing a short video of a task being performed. Have the student perform the task.</p>
    <p>Kinesthetic learners like to learn by doing.<br>
    Typically having good hand-eye coordination, quick reaction and good motor memory skills.<br>
    Games that test these can include interactive and/or reaction based games Coming back to these<br>
    games at a later stage, and seeing if the student can recreate the results of the first time<br>
    playing, but with only simple instructions, i.e. "Perform game 3 again". This can see if the student<br>
    had an easy time remembering the task by performing it themselves.</p>
    <p>Combining all these games into a fluent and easy to use app will give teachers<br>
    the ability to design learning activities that are catered to each student.</p>
    <p>Having a database where all students profiles are kept will allow teachers to simply<br>
    search for a students name/ID, and receive a quick snapshot of the student.<br>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    John, #13245<br>
    Auditory: 30%<br>
    Visual: 60%<br>
    Kinesthetic: 10%<br>
    Learning suggestions for John:<br>
    Use flashcards.<br>
    Draw diagrams and maps.<br>
    etc.</p>
    <p>Alternatively entering a list of all students you have in your class, where you can<br>
    then have access to what percentage the class is as a whole.<br>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    Class A = 15 % Auditory, 30 % Visual and 55 % Kinesthetic.<br>
    Recommended to teach using study groups and having short breaks for interactive activities.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Tools required</h3>
    <p>Software needed to create this app would potentially be a text editor for which ever<br>
    language is to be used, Python or similar. A type of game engine may need to be used, i.e. Unity or Construct2<br>
    As far as hardware goes there should be no need for any as this is going to be a android app<br>
    in which the user can download onto their device</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Skills required</h3>
    <p>A very good understanding of the programming language that is going to be used.<br>
    Experience in creating apps and games plus the publishing of said games.<br>
    knowledge of programs such as Unity and Construct2.<br>
    Tests may also need to be verified via someone in the education development sector.</p>
    <p>Taking courses and watching tutorials will help you obtain the skills needed for the creation of the app.<br>
    Can also look at receiving help from an online community (Github) that could of potentially made a similar app.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>If this project/app was to be completed in a professional manner, and executed correctly<br>
    then this could potentially bring Australia up to a higher standard.<br>
    This can give every student a chance to learn the way that they learn best.<br>
    If successful this could be available for all countries, and even improved upon, i.e. Having<br>
    separate games/activities for learning impaired students.</p>
